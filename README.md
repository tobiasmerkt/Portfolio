# Portfolio
This portfolio contains sample projects I've worked on and is constantly updated. Since I'm running short on time now, I just deleted old files without uploading newer ones. One of my most recent projects which I'm allowed to share was translating the actor-critic Tensorflow tutorial to Jax. Since I couldn't find good examples of AC in Jax online, I decided to share this file here:
