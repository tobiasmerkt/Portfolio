# Portfolio
This portfolio contains sample projects I've worked on and is constantly updated.

## Machine Learning projects:

### Fake News Detection (Python)
In this project, a dataset with newspaper articles is used to train a machine learning model to detect fake news using a Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machines (SVM). By using a grid search, removing stop words, and stemming, the algorithm detects fake news with an accuracy of 93%. 


### Water Pumps Tanzania (R, Group Project)
In this group project, my colleague and I created a Random Forest algorithm which predicts whether water pumps in Tanzania are "functional", "not functional", or "functional needs repair". The dataset and challenge is provided by DRIVENDATA (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/). In this challenge, we achieved an accuracy of 81.96% and have ranked in the top 7% of participants (Date: 18.03.2018).
